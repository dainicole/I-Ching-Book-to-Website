    <h2>Interpreting the Hexagram</h2>
    <p>The hexagram you have created contains words of insight pertaining to your question. Seek to apply the words you're given to the question you asked, in a sincere and introspective way. Suspend preconceptions that may cloud your vision regarding the subject under consideration. Your intuition will confirm whether or not you have been enlightened.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you may not understand the full meaning of your hexagram, as it relates to the question you asked. Whether or not so, be certain that the question you asked is the question that is truly the one most on your mind at the time you cast the coins. Since the pattern of the falling coins is determined, in part, by the cosmic vibrations emanating from your mind, it is possible for the I Ching to answer the question that is really on your mind and not the one you wrote down, if the two are not the same.</p>

    <h2>If your Hexagram contains any 'Dotted' line forms</h2>
    <p>You may have cast one or more "three-of-a-kind" patterns (3-heads or 3-tails), resulting in a 'dotted' line form in your hexagram. If so, there remains further information for you from the I Ching. The dotted line means that your hexagram is soon to undergo a change.</p>
    <p>To learn how it is going to change, you must transform the current hexagram into its future form. You do this by converting the dotted line forms into their opposite forms, that is solid lines become dashed lines and dashed lines become solid lines. For example, using the procedure described above, look up the meaning of the second hexagram, realizing that this second hexagram is predicting a likely future condition regarding the question that you've asked.</p>
