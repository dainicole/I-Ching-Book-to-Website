    <h2>Using the I Ching The Question</h2>
    <p>There is a question burning in your heart and mind. Think about it and then write it down, privately, on a piece of paper. Writing the question down helps you to focus on the precise subject being asked about, thereby avoiding ambiguity. Be sure to word your question so that it requires a commentary type of answer ... i.e., do not ask a question that requires a 'yes'
or 'no' answer. For example, ask "What if..." or "What is this all about...?"</p>

    <h2>History:</h2>
    <p>The I Ching, also known as The Book of Changes, is one of the oldest texts in Chinese history, dating back over 3,000 years to the Western Zhou dynasty. Originally used as a divination manual, it evolved into a profound philosophical work exploring the balance of opposites — yin and yang — and the constant transformation of all things. Over centuries, scholars like Confucius and Laozi drew wisdom from its hexagrams, shaping Chinese thought, ethics, and cosmology. Today, the I Ching endures as both a spiritual guide and a reflection of the natural rhythms that govern life.</p>

    <h2>Casting the Coins</h2>
    <p>With your mind focused on the question you've written down, gather three coins of the same size into your hands, shake them until they are randomly arranged in your hand, then cast them gently upon the table in front of you. Notice how the coins have landed with either beads' or 'tails' facing up.</p>

  <section id="building-trigram" class="section">
    <h2>Building a Trigram:</h2>
    <p>Match the beads or tails' pattern of the cast coins with one of the 4 patterns shown in the following table. Make note of the associated line form next to the matched pattern and write it down. (Note that if you cast three-of-a-kind, the line form will have a dot after it). Repeat this coin casting process 2 more times. each time placing the next line form on top of the previous one. Having done this 3 times, you will have a 3 line figure known as a trigram.</p>

  <section id="building-hexagram" class="section">
    <h2>Building a Hexagram:</h2>
    <p>You need to create 2 trigrams to make a full hexagram. So, create a second trigram using the same process above. When done you will have created a hexagram consisting of a lower trigram (the first one) and an upper trigram (the second one).</p>
